### 3. Unit Tests

**Status:** PASSED

All tests pass with pristine output (no warnings, no errors):

| Package | Tests | Coverage |
|---------|-------|----------|
| cmd/docker-network-viz | 20 | 62.1% |
| internal/docker | 30 | 93.5% |
| internal/models | 14 | 100.0% |
| internal/output | 44 | 98.7% |
| test (integration) | 28 | N/A |

**Total: 136 tests passing**

### 4. Build

**Status:** PASSED

### 5. Real Docker Environment Testing

**Status:** PASSED

The binary was tested with a live Docker environment containing:
- 6 running containers
- 7 networks (bridge, overlay, host, null drivers)

All features verified:
- Network visualization
- Container reachability
- Network filtering (`--only-network`)
- Container filtering (`--container`)
- Alias display toggle (`--no-aliases`)
- Color output and no-color flag

### 6. Code Duplication Check

**Status:** PASSED (with acceptable exceptions)

- No functional code duplication found
- Mock implementations are duplicated across test packages (acceptable due to Go package boundaries)
- Average file size: 199 lines (within acceptable limits)
- Total Go files: 30
- Total lines of Go code: 5,970

### 7. Documentation

**Status:** PASSED

All source files have proper documentation:

| File | Package Doc | Function Docs |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| internal/docker/client.go | Yes | All documented |
| internal/docker/container.go | Yes | All documented |
| internal/docker/network.go | Yes | All documented |
| internal/models/container.go | Yes | All documented |
| internal/models/network.go | Yes | All documented |
| internal/output/container_tree.go | Yes | All documented |
| internal/output/network_tree.go | Yes | All documented |
| internal/output/reachability.go | Yes | All documented |
| internal/output/color.go | Yes | All documented |
| internal/output/tree_symbols.go | Yes | All documented |
| cmd/docker-network-viz/root.go | Yes | All documented |
| cmd/docker-network-viz/visualize.go | Yes | All documented |
| cmd/docker-network-viz/main.go | Yes | All documented |

Markdown documentation files:
- README.md (project overview)
- CONTRIBUTING.md (development guide)
- Makefile.md (build system docs)
- PRD.md (product requirements)
- .golangci.md (linter configuration)
- cmd/docker-network-viz/README.md
- cmd/docker-network-viz/main.md
- internal/docker/README.md
- internal/output/README.md
- internal/models/container.md
- test/README.md

### 8. File Organization

**Status:** PASSED

- Each Handler, Model, Controller in its own file
- Smaller source files preferred (average 199 lines)
- Clear package separation
- Consistent naming conventions

## Makefile Targets Verified

| Target | Status |
|--------|--------|
| `make lint` | PASSED |
| `make test` | PASSED |
| `make build` | PASSED |
| `make fmt` | PASSED |
| `make clean` | PASSED |
| `make tidy` | PASSED |

## Recommendations

1. Consider adding end-to-end tests that spawn a real Docker container network for more comprehensive testing
2. Consider publishing to a Docker Hub repository for easy installation
3. Consider adding GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

## Conclusion

The docker-network-viz project has passed all quality checks and meets the Ocom Go development standards. The code is:

- Well-structured and maintainable
- Thoroughly tested (136 tests with high coverage)
- Properly documented
- Free of linting issues
- Ready for production deployment
